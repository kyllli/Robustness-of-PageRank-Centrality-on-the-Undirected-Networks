# Robustness of PageRank Centrality

Honors thesis exploring the robustness of the PageRank algorithm with respect to three structural properties of undirected real-world networks: clustering coefficient, degree distribution, and community structure. Simulated synthetic networks using the Chungâ€“Lu and Stochastic Block Model (SBM) frameworks to replicate real-world characteristics and evaluate the stability of PageRank rankings under varying network conditions.
